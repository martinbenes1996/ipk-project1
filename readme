This project is basic client-server application. It is able to send files
using designed protocol. It compiles with make call (or gmake).

It is used:
1) First run server at known IP address.
  $ ./ipk-server -p <server-port>
2) Then run client.
  $ ./ipk-client -h <server-address> -p <server-port> [-r|-w] <filename>

Use -r <filename> to read the file from the working directory of server and
it will be saved into <filename> (doc/dokumentace.pdf will save file
dokumentace.pdf in server working directory to client's doc/dokumentace.pdf, if
the directory doc/ exists).

Use -w <filename> to write the file to the working directory of the server from
<filename> (doc/dokumentace.pdf will save dokumentace.pdf in server working
directory from the client's doc/dokumentace.pdf, if exists).



Limitations:
The application was not tested for packet loss.
The application was not tested for concurrent access to one file.
